## What is interesting to me about Roadster is its powerful software designed by the following programming languages 

1. ```python
   car = "roadster"
   print(var)
   ```
2. ```java
   String car = "roadster"
   system.out.println(car);
   ```
3. ```c++
   car = "roadster"
   cout<< car <<endl;
   ```
